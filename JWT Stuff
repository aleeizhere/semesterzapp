When the user logs in and their credentials verifies.
The server responses back with the token that reaches the front end.

We can simply authenticate users by looking at their username, find that username in the DB
and if that username exists we will check what type of user he is and whether is allowed to visit that path or not.

User ne front end se token bheja, server ne token ko decode kia uss main se information nikaali, uss info ki buniyaad pe db main banda search kia
